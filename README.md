# examplecode

This repository contains example codes (Machine learning algorithms, Deep learning, etc..) to attest towards my programming capabilities (especially Python). This code will mostly be in Python and follow the template from the Udemy courses "Machine learning A to Z: Hands-on Python and R in Data Science" and "Deep learning A to Z: Hands-on Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko.
